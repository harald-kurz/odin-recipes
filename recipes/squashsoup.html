    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This roasted butternut squash soup is my favorite fall soup of all time.
      It's inexpensive, easy, nutritious, and absolutely delicious!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're feeling like something a bit more substantial, try this soup
      topped with a handful of crispy bacon or diced ham.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 1/2) pound butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
      <li>6 whole garlic cloves, peeled</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
      <li>and more</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Start the soup: Drizzle olive oil into large roasting pan. Add onion,
        carrots, garlic cloves, and a big pinch of salt; toss until vegetables
        are coated in oil. Place squash halves onto the chopped vegetables with
        the cut sides facing up. Sprinkle squash with additional salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven until squash is tender and easily pierced
        with the tip of a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and allow
        vegetables to cool a bit.
